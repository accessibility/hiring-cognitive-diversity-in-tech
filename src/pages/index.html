<h2>Hiring neurodiverse technologists can benefit your IT teams!</h2>
<p>Hiring Cognitive is here to help companies and hiring managers understand the best hiring and interview practises to accesses qualified candidates who may learn and interact differently, candidates who may be inadvertently falling through the cracks of the current hiring and interview norms withing tech.</p>

<p>If you’re a savvy IT exec or hiring professional, and you must be if you’re here, then you’ve likely heard a little already about this neurodiversity, or Cognitive Diversity, thing. Maybe you’ve even read “<a href= "https://hbr.org/2017/05/neurodiversity-as-a-competitive-advantage">Neurodiversity as a Competitive Advantage</a>” in the Harvard Business Review (HBR) and you’re wondering, “How can I tap into this in demand skills base?” If you’re not quite sure what I’m talking about, don’t worry, you’ll be hip to this emerging innovation by the time you leave here. More than that you’ll learn how to bring Cognitive Diversity to your technology teams, joining the ranks of innovators like Microsoft, Ford, IBM, Chase and more (Austin and Pisano, HBR) who are seeking out this minority population and experiencing great results for their efforts.  </p>

<p>What is this Cognitive Diversity thing anyway? We’ll start with our nearly synonymous sister term neurodiversity. “Nurodiversity is the idea that neurological differences like Autism and ADHD are the result of normal, natural variation in the human genome” (Robinson, Psychology Today). Neurodiverse people, like those on the Autism spectrum, with diagnosis like dyspraxia, dyslexia, ADHD and more are differently abled than our neurotypical peers. Cognitive Diversity, for the purposes of this site, goes a step further to include those who may identify strongly with the term disability and have concerns that the neurodiversity movement could inadvertently erase the very real struggles they face that other groups may not. This can include people with any of the diagnoses above and loop in those with sometimes trauma induced differences like PTSD, depression, anxiety and others. Like all populations, there isn’t really agreement on the question of labels (we are all different after all), but imo that’s ok. </p>

<p>What’s important here is this: those who are neurologically different than the majority have skills to share, strengths and weaknesses like everyone else, but the world as we all know turns for the majority. The technology sector is no different and in fact it might even be one of the worst offenders. As a result this amazing population of workers are struggling to get into the jobs for which they are most qualified. Let me say this next piece really loud so we’re clear, <bold>“The standard tech interview process itself, designed by and for the neurotypical mind, is keeping Cognitive Diversity out of your company”.</bold> Our goal here at Hiring Cognitive is to help you remedy that problem.</p>
