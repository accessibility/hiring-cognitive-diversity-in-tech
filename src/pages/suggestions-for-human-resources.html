<h2>"Find the best person for the job, not just the one who interviews best."1 </h2>

<p>Everyone should have the same right to show their capabilities at work, and to lead a purpose driven life in which their contributions are seen and valued. An equitable hiring process is the first step to making this possible!</p>

<p>"The interviewing process can be intimidating for anyone, but for those on the autism spectrum it can pose an especially unique challenge.  Often, employers tie an applicant's ability to do a certain job in with their sociability and performance in an interview setting.  This can put those with autism at a disadvantage because of their different communication and social skills."2 This can be similarly true for other forms of Cognitive Diversity as well. </p>

<h2>Here are some tips from <a href="https://hireautism.org/resource-center/interviewing-your-applicant-with-autism">Interviewing Your Applicant With Autism by HireAutism.org</a></h2>

<p>Some ways to modify the interviewing process:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Give candidates a detailed outline of what the interview will involve.  If he or she requests it, supply a copy of the interview questions ahead of time to allow that person to get familiar with them.</li>
  <li>Be flexible in re-asking or rewording questions to more effectively gather the information that you want.  If the candidate hesitates before answering, allow the person a moment to collect his or her thoughts and give a response.  This could be the individual calling upon "filters" in preparing an appropariate answer.</li>
  <li>Make the candidate feel comfortable, and consider asking what, if any, particular accomodations that person may need to feel at ease.</li>
  <li>Depending on the skills required for the specific position, consider creating an alternate method to assess the candidate's capabilities and "fit" for the job.  This might be an observational assessment which could exist in lieu of a formal interview or in conjuction with one.  For example, if an interview setting does not represent an individual's ability to perform the necessary tasks, have the applicant do a sample of the work required for the position as you observe.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Ways to adapt questions during an interview:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you can, ask questions that are direct and literal rather than general and abstract.  For example, instead of asking your candidate about a time where he or she may have overcome a challenge, lay out a specific problem that might arise in the office and have the candidate outline steps to solve it.</li>
  <li>Use examples in your questions when possible; it will illustrate the intent of the question and will allow the applicant to more easily process and respond appropriately.</li>
  <li>Ask more open-ended questions, avoiding questions that can be answered with a "yes" or "no," in order to gather the information you need.  Ask follow-up questions to help applicants expand on previous answers.</li>
</ul>
