title: What is cognitive diversity?
layout: layouts/base.njk
---

<p>Cognitive diversity is an umbrella term for changes that occur within the brain that are considered to be normal variations or a normal result of challenging life experiences. These changes allow people to process information in different and often new and creative ways. The cognitively diverse will often process and address problems differently, see details others might not notice, ask question others might not think to ask and more. This means that cognitive diversity can be a largely a positive thing, especially in a supportive environment with diversity and inclusion in mind. </p>

<p>In this section you'll find testimonials from technologists who identify as cognitively diverse. These were gathered via a small qualitative study, initiated by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/larunda-accessibility">Larunda Accessibility Solutions</a> via the <a href="https://www.deque.com/axe-con/axe-hackathon/"> 2021 axe-hackathon</a> event. Our hope is to see this research funded so that it can be expanded to include a more diverse range of cognitive diversities and provide even more remedies for hiring professionals. If you're interested in either funding or taking part in this study, please reach out via email to <a href="mailto:hello@larundatech.com">hello@larundatech.com</a></p>

    The aptitudes of those with different cognitive-wiring styles can be ideal for tech and design. Let's take a look at the gifts that Neurodivergent people can bring to the table. Below you will find strengths for just a few populations included in the NEURODIVERGENT umbrella.

<p>
    Just remember: People may have one or more types of neurodivergence, and as an individual, their talents will be unique to them. So please, as important as it is to know how valuable Neurodivergent people are for the workplace, try your best to avoid using any stereotype, positive or negative, when making assumptions about any specific applicant.
